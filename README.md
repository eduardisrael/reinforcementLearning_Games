# ReinforcementLearning in Games
Artificial Intelligence course project / @ESPOL

Team: Israel Pasaca, Estefano Palacios, Vielka Villavicencio

The Goal
Our interest is thus in:

1. The development of autonomous, free-range driving agents for real-time game applications. Specifically, we seek to design agents that adapt intelligently to avoid any obstacles in their path when they are presented with a target destination, all the while pursuing such a goal greedily to defeat the player and other agents. Finally, we want our agents to learn how to navigate through mazes of arbitrary complexity.

2. To create game AI that surprises players long after their exposure to the game, and, from that to create a game with capitalizes on the strengths of the system for an interesting experience.
